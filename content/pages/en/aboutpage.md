  - body: >
      My work as a front-end developer is based on a general responsibility,
      like a mantra:


      > ***"Ensuring that users can easily interact with the website."***


      Through languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I create the
      structure, style, and all the dynamic elements of a web page with which
      the user interacts.
